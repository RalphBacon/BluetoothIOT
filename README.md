# BluetoothIOT
Control anything using your Smartphone &amp; an Arduino

Join me in creating the Android phone app for controlling an HC-05 or HC-06 Bluetooth module. It's as easy as putting a puzzle together (large pieces, ages 6-9!) and once you have started it's easy to create complex programs quickly.

You can download the App and install it on your phone as well as the project for the code in "MIT App Inventor 2" so you get the "source code" and can then tweak it any way you want.

The links that you may need after following the video are right here in the GitHub:
https://github.com/RalphBacon/BluetoothIOT

They consist of, individually:

1. The Android Phone App - send it to your phone in an email, click the attachment and install it using the Package Installer

2. The "MIT App Inventor 2" source code project, also known as the ".aia file". Save this on your PC and import it to the website as shown in the video - then you will have exactly my source code and can tweak it as you please

3. To speed things up, here the the webpage for the MIT App Inventor:

As I mentioned in the video, please suggest practical applications for using Bluetooth from your phone to control an Arduino and we will see what fantastic projects people come up with.

As always, Thanks For Watching!
